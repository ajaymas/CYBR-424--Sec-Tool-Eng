# 🧠 Lecture 17: Network Defense — Practical Lab Guide (Ubuntu-based)

This lab follows the lecture concepts with **hands-on exercises** using Linux (Ubuntu/Debian).  
Each section includes: concept, real-world context, command walkthroughs, expected outputs, and screenshot placeholders.

---

## 🔐 1. Defense in Depth (DiD)

**Concept:** Layered security ensures that even if one defense fails, others protect the system.

**Example:** Firewall + IDS + MFA + Backup = Reduced overall risk.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
sudo ufw status numbered
```
- `ufw` stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. It is a frontend for `iptables` designed to make firewall management easier on Linux systems, especially for basic setups.

### 📊 Expected Output
```
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
80/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere
23/tcp                     DENY        Anywhere
```

## ⚖️ 2. Risk Management

**Concept:** Risk = Threat × Vulnerability. Manage by patching, isolating, and monitoring.

**Example:** Patch outdated PHP; scan network for open services.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo nmap -sS localhost
sudo apt list --upgradable
```

## 🧠 3. Threats and Vulnerabilities

**Concept:** Weak passwords, unpatched software, and open services increase attack surface.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo grep -E '^[^:]+:[^\!*]' /etc/shadow
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

## 🧱 4. Defense-in-Depth Approaches

| Approach | Focus | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Uniform Protection | Equal security everywhere | Antivirus across all systems |
| Protected Enclaves | Segmentation | VLANs for HR/Finance |
| Information-Centric | Secure data itself | Database encryption |
| Vector-Oriented | Secure entry points | Disable USB, ports |
| Role-Based Access | Restrict by job | RBAC in Linux |

### 🧪 Commands (RBAC Example)
```bash
sudo groupadd finance
sudo useradd -G finance ajay
sudo mkdir /secure_finance
sudo chown :finance /secure_finance
sudo chmod 770 /secure_finance
```

## 🌐 5. Network Attacks Overview

**Concept:** Malicious activities like DoS, spoofing, and routing exploitation.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo hping3 -S -p 80 -i u100 <target-ip>
sudo tcpdump -n -i eth0 tcp
```
⚠️ Use only in controlled lab networks.

## 🌍 6. ICMP and IP Layer Attacks

**Concept:** Exploiting trust in network protocols — ARP spoofing, ICMP redirect, etc.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo arp -n
sudo arping <target-ip>
```
📸 *[Screenshot: ARP table entries]*

---

## 🔗 8. TCP Layer Attacks

**Concept:** Exploiting TCP handshake and session trust.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo ss -tnp
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
Use to inspect active TCP connections and DNS configurations.

📸 *[Screenshot: ss output]*

---

## 🚫 8. Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)

**Concept:** Exhausts bandwidth or processing power to deny service.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo iftop -i eth0
sudo tcpdump -c 1000 -w ddos_trace.pcap
```
**Expected Output:** Network traffic spikes; pcap file captured.

## 🧰 9. Network Hardening and Exposure Minimization

**Concept:** Reduce attack surface by disabling unused services, patching, and auditing.

### 🧪 Commands
```bash
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Failed password for invalid user admin from 192.168.1.10 port 51234 ssh2
```

## ✅ Summary Checklist

| Area | Tool/Command | Purpose |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Firewall | `ufw` | Restrict ports |
| Scanning | `nmap` | Detect open services |
| Encryption | `gpg` | Protect data confidentiality |
| Monitoring | `iftop`, `tcpdump` | Watch network activity |
| Hardening | `systemctl`, `apt` | Reduce exposure |
